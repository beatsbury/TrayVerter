# TrayVerter
A Windows 10 service that changes the system color (i.e. panel color type) from dark to light, according to chosen wallpaper.
It can be installed using installutil command in VS developer console.

It was created specifically for users of "transparent tray" apps, like [FalconX](https://github.com/ChrisAnd1998/FalconX-Center-Taskbar).
However, It does it's work nice enough (if not-exactly-logical somehow) even for non-transparent tray.

Separate installer is to be added after the main code is stable enough.
